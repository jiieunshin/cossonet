Description: The cossonet package provides tools for fitting COSSO models to various types of response data, including continuous, count, binary, and survival outcomes. It supports nonparametric regression using kernel-based methods and elastic-net regularization. Functions like cossonet.exp and cossonet.cox enable flexible modeling for exponential family and survival data, respectively, offering robust solutions for complex regression problems.
