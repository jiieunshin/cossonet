\description{
The cdcosso function is a function that solves component selection using the Coordinate Descent algorithm.
This function can be applied to various response variables, continuous, count, binary, and survival analysis.
Because it is a type of nonparametric inference, various types of kernels can be selected.
To select hyperparameters, the function is designed to perform cross-validation.
